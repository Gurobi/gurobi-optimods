Extending a Mod
===============

A place to discuss how to take an existing mod and add functionality.

1. Navigating the code (how to find the mod)
2. Adding tests for new features (new mod features must be opt-in)
3. Scope of a single mod: past a certain level of complexity or scope of
   changes, a whole new mod might be more appropriate
