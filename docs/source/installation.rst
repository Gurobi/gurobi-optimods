Installation
============

``gurobi-optimods`` can be installed directly from PyPI::

This will also install ``gurobipy``, ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``pandas``, and
``gurobipy-pandas`` as dependencies.

Please note that gurobipy is commercial software and requires a license (which
you can get `for free as an academic
<https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/>`_). When
installed via pip or conda, gurobipy ships with an evaluation license which is
only for testing and can only solve models of limited size. You will be able to
run all the examples given in this documentation using this evaluation license.
