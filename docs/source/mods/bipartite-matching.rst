Maximum Bipartite Matching
==========================

Something about specific graph algorithms vs mathprog formulations?

Problem Specification
---------------------

Consider a bipartite graph :math:`G(U, V, E)`, where :math:`U` and :math:`V`
are disjoint vertex sets, and the edge set :math:`E \subseteq U \times V`
joins only between, not within, the sets. A matching on this graph is any
subset of edges such that no vertex is incident to more than one edge. A
maximum matching is the largest possible matching on :math:`G`.

The bipartite matching problem can be reduced to a maximum flow problem by
introducing a source vertex as a predecessor to all vertices in :math:`U`,
and a sink vertex as a successor to all vertices in :math:`V`. Giving every
edge unit capacity, a maximum matching is found by maximizing flow from the
source to the sink. All edges with non-zero flow in the max flow solution
are part of the matching.

Note that we need a basic solution! TU and all that.

    import scipy.sparse as sp

    from gurobi_optimods.matching import maximum_bipartite_matching

    # Create a simple bipartite graph as a sparse matrix
    nodes1 = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    nodes2 = np.array([5, 6, 7])
    row = [0, 3, 4, 0, 1, 3]
    col = [7, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7]
    data = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    adjacency = sp.coo_array((data, (row, col)), shape=(8, 8))

    # Compute the maximum matching
    matching = maximum_bipartite_matching(adjacency, nodes1, nodes2)

The ``maximum_bipartite_matching`` function formulates a linear program for the
the network flow model corresponding to the given bipartite graph. Gurobi
solves this model using a network primal simplex algorithm.

Solution
--------

The maximum matching is returned as a subgraph of the original bipartite
graph, as a ``scipy.sparse`` array. Inspecting the result, it is clear that
this is a maximum matching, since no two edges share a node in common, and
all nodes in the second set are incident to an edge in the matching.

.. doctest:: bipartite_matching
    :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> print(sp.triu(matching))
      (0, 7)        1.0
      (1, 6)        1.0
      (3, 5)        1.0

We can also inspect the result by plotting the graph and the edges selected
in the matching using networkx.

.. doctest:: bipartite_matching
    :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>>
    >>> fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
    >>> g = nx.from_scipy_sparse_array(adjacency)
    >>> layout = nx.bipartite_layout(g, nodes1)
    >>> nx.draw(g, layout, ax=ax1)
    >>> g = nx.from_scipy_sparse_array(matching)
    >>> nx.draw(g, layout, ax=ax2)
