Maximum Flow / Minimum Cut
==========================

The maximum flow and minimum cut problems are closely related due to their
mathematical properties. In the former, we are aiming to find the maximum flow
that can be routed through a given network from source vertex to sink vertex
subject to some edge capacities. The latter finds a set of edges, or a cut, that
minimises the total capacity of the edges which if removed would disconnect the
source from the sink.

The first algorithm to solve this problem was proposed
:footcite:t:`ford1956maximal`, called the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
Additionally, they also showed the relationship between these problems, that the
maximum flow value is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut. Later on,
:footcite:t:`goldberg1988new` proposed the famous push-relabel algorithm, and
more recently :footcite:t:`orlin2013max` and other authors have proposed
polynomial-time algorithms.

From the mathematical properties of these problems
:footcite:p:`ford1956maximal`.

Problem Specification
---------------------

We provide the graph theory and mathematical definition of this problem.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Graph Theory

        For a given graph :math:`G` with set of vertices :math:`V` and edges
        :math:`E`. Each edge :math:`(i,j)\in E` has a capacity attribute
        :math:`B_{ij}\in\mathbb{R}`.

        Given a source and sink vertices :math:`s\in V` and :math:`t\in V`,
        respectively, the problems can be stated as finding:

        - the flow with maximum value from source to sink such that the flow is
          capacity feasible.
        - the set of edges which disconnects the source and sink such that the
          total capacity is minimised.

    .. tab:: Optimization Model

        Let us define a set of continuous variables :math:`x_{ij}` to represent
        the amount of non-negative (:math:`\geq 0`) flow going through an edge
        :math:`(i,j)\in E`.


        The mathematical formulation for the maximum flow can be stated as
        follows:

        .. math::

            \begin{alignat}{2}
              \max \quad        & \sum_{j \in \delta^+(s)} x_{sj} \\
              \mbox{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{j \in \delta^-(i)} x_{ji} = \sum_{j \in \delta^+(i)} x_{ij} & \quad\forall i \in V\setminus\{s,t\} \\
                                & 0 \leq x_{ij} \le B_{ij} & \forall (i, j) \in E \\
            \end{alignat}

        Where :math:`\delta^+(\cdot)` (:math:`\delta^-(\cdot)`) denotes the
        outgoing (incoming) neighbours.

        The objective maximises the total flow outgoing from the source vertex.

        The first constraints ensure flow balance for all vertices (other than
        the source or sink). That is, for a given node, the outgoing flow must
        be equal to the incoming flow.

        The last constraints ensure non-negativity of the variables and that the
        capacity per edge is not exceeded.

Code and Inputs
---------------

For this mod, one can use input graphs of different types:

* pandas: using a ``pd.DataFrame``;
* NetworkX: using a ``nx.DiGraph`` or ``nx.Graph``;
* SciPy.sparse: using some ``sp.sparray`` matrices and NumPy's ``np.ndarray``.

An example of these inputs with their respective requirements is shown below.

      and contains columns labelled ``capacity`` with the edge attributes.

      The ``node_data`` DataFrame is indexed by node and contains columns
      labelled ``demand``.

Solution
--------

Depending on the input of choice, the solution also comes with different
formats.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: pandas

      .. doctest:: max_flow_min_cut
          :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

          >>> from gurobi_optimods import datasets
          >>> from gurobi_optimods.max_flow import max_flow
          >>> edge_data, _ = datasets.simple_graph_pandas()
          >>> obj, flow = max_flow(edge_data, 0, 5, verbose=False) # Find max-flow between nodes 0 and 5
          >>> obj
          3.0
          >>> flow
          source  target
          0       1         1.0
                  2         2.0
          1       3         1.0
          2       3         1.0
                  4         1.0
          3       5         2.0
          4       5         1.0
          Name: flow, dtype: float64
          >>> from gurobi_optimods.min_cut import min_cut
          >>> obj, partition, cutset = min_cut(edge_data, 0, 5, verbose=False)
          >>> obj
          3.0
          >>> partition
          ({0, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 5})
          >>> cutset
          {(0, 2), (1, 3)}

      The ``max_flow`` function returns the cost of the solution as well
      as ``pd.Series`` with the flow per edge. Similarly as the input
      DataFrame the resulting series is indexed by ``source`` and ``target``.
      In this case, the resulting maximum flow has value 3.

      The ``min_cut`` function returns the mimimum cutset value, the partition
      of the nodes and the edges in the cutset.


  .. group-tab:: NetworkX

      .. doctest:: max_flow_min_cut_networkx
          :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

          >>> from gurobi_optimods import datasets
          >>> from gurobi_optimods.max_flow import max_flow
          >>> G = datasets.simple_graph_networkx()
          >>> obj, sol = max_flow(G, 0, 5, verbose=False)
          >>> obj
          3.0
          >>> type(sol)
          <class 'networkx.classes.digraph.DiGraph'>
          >>> list(sol.edges(data=True))
          [(0, 1, {'flow': 1.0}), (0, 2, {'flow': 2.0}), (1, 3, {'flow': 1.0}), (2, 3, {'flow': 1.0}), (2, 4, {'flow': 1.0}), (3, 5, {'flow': 2.0}), (4, 5, {'flow': 1.0})]
          >>> from gurobi_optimods.min_cut import min_cut
          >>> obj, part, cut = min_cut(G, 0, 5, verbose=False)
          >>> obj
          3.0
          >>> part
          ({0, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 5})
          >>> cut
          {(0, 2), (1, 3)}

      The ``max_flow`` function returns the cost of the solution
      as well as a dictionary indexed by edge with the non-zero flow.

      The ``min_cut`` function returns the mimimum cutset value, the partition
      of the nodes and the edges in the cutset.

  .. group-tab:: scipy.sparse

      .. doctest:: max_flow_min_cut_scipy
          :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

          >>> from gurobi_optimods import datasets
          >>> from gurobi_optimods.max_flow import max_flow
          >>> G, capacities, _, _ = datasets.simple_graph_scipy()
          >>> G.data = capacities.data
          >>> obj, sol = max_flow(G, 0, 5, verbose=False)
          >>> obj
          3.0
          >>> sol
          <5x6 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'
              with 6 stored elements in COOrdinate format>
          >>> print(sol)
            (0, 1)    1.0
            (0, 2)    2.0
            (1, 3)    1.0
            (2, 4)    2.0
            (3, 5)    1.0
            (4, 5)    2.0
          >>> from gurobi_optimods.min_cut import min_cut
          >>> obj, part, cutset = min_cut(G, 0, 5, verbose=False)
          >>> obj
          3.0
          >>> part
          ({0, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 5})
          >>> cutset
          {(0, 2), (1, 3)}

      The ``max_flow`` function returns the flow of the solution as
      well as a ``sp.sparray`` with the edges where the data is the amount of
      non-zero flow in the solution.

      The ``min_cut`` function returns the mimimum cutset value, the partition
      of the nodes and the edges in the cutset.

The solution for this example is shown in the figure below. The edge labels
denote the edge capacity and resulting flow: :math:`(B_{ij}, x^*_{ij})`. All
edges in the maximum flow solution carry some flow, totalling at 3.0 at the
sink. The cutset from the minimum solution is shown with the edges in blue, and
the nodes in the partitions are shown in blue and in green.
