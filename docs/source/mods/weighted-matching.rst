Maximum Weighted Matching
=========================

Something about specific graph algorithms vs mathprog formulations?

Problem Specification
---------------------

You are given a weighted graph G containing n vertices and m edges. Find the maximum weighted matching, i.e. select s subset of edges such that that no selected edge shares a vertex with any other selected edge, and the sum of edge weights for the selected set is maximised.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Domain-Specific Description

        A matching is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges ...

    .. tab:: Optimization Model

        For each edge :math:`(i,j)` in graph :math:`G = (V, E)`, we should select a subset. So define variables as follows

        .. math::

            x_{ij} = \begin{cases}
                1 & \text{if edge}\,(i,j)\,\text{is selected in the matching} \\
                0 & \text{otherwise.} \\
            \end{cases}

        and the mathematical model as (check undirected terminology/notation here)

        .. math::

            \begin{alignat}{2}
            \max \quad        & \sum_{(i, j) \in E} w_{ij} x_{ij} \\
            \mbox{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{j \in N(i)} x_{ij} \le 1 & \forall i \in V \\
                              & x_{ij} \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace & \forall (i, j) \in E. \\
            \end{alignat}

        Note that for the general (non-bipartite) case, this model must be formulated and solved as a MIP, as there is no guarantee that simplex will return an integer solution for the relaxation.

Code
----

Show the code required to run the model from the store vs how to implement directly in gurobipy. All the gurobi internals are handled for you; users interact with the 'solver' by passing dataframes to a given spec and receiving a dataframe as output.

.. testcode:: weighted_matching

    import scipy.sparse as sp

    from gurobi_optimods.matching import maximum_weighted_matching

    # Weighted graph as a sparse matrix.
    row = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
    col = [3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
    data = [1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1, 1.2]
    G = sp.coo_matrix((data, (row, col)), shape=(6, 6))

    # Compute max matching.
    matching = maximum_weighted_matching(G)

.. testoutput:: weighted_matching
    :hide:

    ...
    Best objective 2.400000000000e+00, best bound 2.400000000000e+00, gap 0.0000%

Both codes construct the same model and give the same result. The model is solved as a LP/MIP/QP/etc by Gurobi.

Solution
--------

Show the solution. Use doctests if possible (i.e. the solution must be stable enough). Otherwise, just display it somehow.

.. doctest:: weighted_matching
    :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> matching
    <6x6 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'
        with 2 stored elements in COOrdinate format>

.. doctest:: weighted_matching
    :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> g = nx.from_scipy_sparse_array(G)
    >>> layout = nx.random_layout(g, seed=0)
    >>> fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
    >>> nx.draw(g, layout, ax=ax1)
    >>> g = nx.from_scipy_sparse_array(matching)
    >>> nx.draw(g, layout, ax=ax2)
